                MINOR ELECTRICAL INSTALLATION WORKS CERTIFICATE

			<h2 class="title">
				Notes for the person producing the Certificate:
			</h2>
			<p class="statement-list">
				The Minor Electrical Installation Works Certificate is intended to be used for additions and
				alterations to an installation that do not extend to the provision of a new circuit.
				Examples include the addition of socket-outlets or lighting points to an existing circuit,
				the relocation of a light switch etc. This Certificate may also be used for the replacement of
				equipment such as accessories or luminaires, but not for the replacement of distribution boards or
				similar items. Appropriate inspection and testing, however, should always be carried out irrespective
				of the extent of the work undertaken.
			</p>

			<h2 class="title">
				GUIDANCE FOR RECIPIENTS (to be appended to the Certificate):
			</h2>
			<p class="statement-list">
				This Certificate has been issued to confirm that the electrical installation work to
				which it relates has been designed, constructed, inspected and tested in accordance with
				British Standard 7671 (the IET Wiring Regulations). You should have received an 'original'
				Certificate and the contractor should have retained a duplicate. If you were the person
				ordering the work, but not the owner of the installation, you should pass this
				Certificate, or a copy of it, to the owner. A separate Certificate should have been
				received for each existing circuit on which minor works have been carried out.
				This Certificate is not appropriate if you requested the contractor to undertake more extensive
				installation work, for which you should have received an Electrical Installation Certificate.
				The Certificate should be retained in a safe place and be shown to any person inspecting
				or undertaking further work on the electrical installation in the future. If you later vacate
				the property, this Certificate will demonstrate to the new owner that the minor
				electrical installation work carried out complied with the requirements of
				British Standard 7671 at the time the Certificate was issued.
