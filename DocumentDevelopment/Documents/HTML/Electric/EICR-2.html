				Notes for the person producing this Report:

			<ol class="statement-list">
                <li>
                    This Report should only be used for reporting on the condition of an existing electrical
                    installation, and notfor the replacement of a consumer unit/distribution board. An
                    installation which was designed to an earlier edition of the Regulations and which does
                    not fully comply with the current edition is not necessarily unsafe for continued use,
                    or requires upgrading. Only damage, deterioration, defects, dangerous conditions and
                    non-compliance with the irements of the Regulations, which may give rise to danger,
                    should be recorded.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Report, normally comprising at least five pages, should include schedules of both
                    the inspection and the test results. Additional pages may be necessary for other than
                    a simple installation and for the 'Guidance for recipients'. The number of each page
                    should be indicated, together with the total number of pages involved.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The reason for producing this Report, such as change of occupancy or landlord’s periodic
                    maintenance, should be identified in Section B.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Those elements of the installation that are covered by the Report and those that are not
                    should be identified in Section D (Extent and limitations). These aspects should have been
                    agreed with the person ordering the report and other interested parties before the
                    inspection and testing commenced. Any operational limitations, such as inability to
                    gain access to parts of the installation or an item of equipment, should also
                    be recorded in Section D.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The maximum prospective value of fault current (Ipf) recorded should be the greater of either
                    the prospective value of short-circuit current or the prospective value of earth fault current.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Where an installation has an alternative source of supply a further schedule of supply
                    characteristics and earthing arrangements based upon Section I of this Report should be provided.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A summary of the condition of the installation in terms of safety should be clearly
                    stated in Section E. Observations, if any, should be categorised in
                    Section K using the coding C1 to C3 as appropriate. Any observation given a code C1 or
                    C2 classification should result in the overall condition of the installation being
                    reported as unsatisfactory.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Wherever practicable, items classified as ‘Danger present’ (C1) should be made safe on
                    discovery. Where this is not possible the owner or user should be given written
                    notification as a matter of urgency.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Where an observation requires further investigation (FI) because the inspection has
                    revealed an apparent deficiency which could not, owing to the extent or limitations
                    of the inspection, be fully identified and further investigation may reveal a code C1
                    or C2 item, this should be recorded within Section K, given the code FI and marked as
                    unsatisfactory in Section E.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the space available for observations in Section K is insufficient, additional pages
                    should be provided as necessary.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The date by which the next Electrical Installation Condition Report is recommended
                    should be given in Section F. The interval between inspections should take into account
                    the type and usage of the installation and its overall condition.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Any deficiencies with intake equipment should be reported to the person ordering the work.
