                <li>
                    The purpose of this Report is to confirm, so far as reasonably practicable,
                    whether or not the electrical installation is in a satisfactory condition for continued
                    service (see Section E). The Report should identify any damage, deterioration,
                    defects and/or conditions which may give rise to danger (see Section K).
                </li>
                <li>
                    The person ordering the Report should have received the 'original' Report and the
                    inspector should have retained a duplicate.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The 'original' Report should be retained in a safe place and be made available to any
                    person inspecting or undertaking work on the electrical installation in the future.
                    If the property is vacated, this Report will provide the new owner/occupier with
                    details of the condition of the electrical installation at the time the Report was issued.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Where the installation incorporates a residual current device (RCD) there should be a notice
                    at or near the device stating that it should be tested six-monthly. For safety reasons
                    it is important that this instruction is followed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Section D (Extent and Limitations) should identify fully the extent of the installation
                    covered by this Report and any limitations on the inspection and testing. The inspector
                    should have agreed these aspects with the person ordering the Report and with other
                    interested parties (licensing authority, insurance company, mortgage provider and the like)
                    before the inspection was carried out.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Some operational limitations such as inability to gain access to parts of the
                    installation or an item of equipment may have been encountered during the inspection.
                    The inspector should have noted these in Section D.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For items classified in Section K as C1 ('Danger present'), the safety of those using
                    the installation is at risk, and it is recommended that a skilled person or
                    persons competent in electrical installation work undertakes the necessary
                    remedial work immediately.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For items classified in Section K as C2 ('Potentially dangerous'), the safety of those
                    using the installation may be at risk and it is recommended that a skilled person or
                    persons competent in electrical installation work undertakes the necessary remedial work
                    as a matter of urgency.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Where it has been stated in Section K that an observation requires further investigation
                    (code FI) the inspection has revealed an apparent deficiency which may result in a code
                    C1 or C2, and could not, due to the extent or limitations of the inspection,
                    be fully identified. Such observations should be investigated without delay.
                    A further examination of the installation will be necessary, to determine the
                    nature and extent of the apparent deficiency (see Section F).
                </li>
                <li>
                    For safety reasons, the electrical installation should be re-inspected at appropriate
                    intervals by a skilled person or persons, competent in such work . The recommended date
                    by which the next inspection is due is stated in Section F of the Report under
                    ‘Recommendations’ and on a label at or near to the consumer unit/ distribution board.

                    Section 1.0. Where inadequacies in the intake equipment are encountered the inspector should

                    Older installations designed prior to BS 7671:2018 may not have been provided with RCDs for
                    additional protection. The absence of such protection should as a minimum be given a code
                    C3 classification (item 5.12).
